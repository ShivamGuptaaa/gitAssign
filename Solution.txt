git commit -m "initial commit of add.py on Dev branch"
git checkout -b Test
git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit of mul and sub on Test branch"
git checkout Dev
notepad add.py
git diff
git status
git checkout -b master	(I needed to create a master branch because master was not showing in list after command "git branch"...after some research i got to know master branch will not list under it until I commit something in it, so creating it and will merge everything it)

(As I changed some text in add.py it is untracked but i am neither pushing it to staging area nor committing it as you didn't asked for it... If you wanted me to stage and commit then commands would be:- git add add.py , git commit -m "changed some text in add.py")

git merge Dev	(It shows "Already up to date")
git merege Test	(It is updating files)\

(In GitHub created a Repo named gitAssign)

git remote add origin https://github.com/ShivamGuptaaa/gitAssign.git
git push -u origin master

(Another folder for cloning)
mkdir clonedGitAssign
cd clonedGitAssign
git init
git clone https://github.com/ShivamGuptaaa/gitAssign.git
cd gitAssign
notepad Solution.txt

(Now copying this all content in Solution.txt, then will stage, commit and then finally push it to GitHub and share the link)
